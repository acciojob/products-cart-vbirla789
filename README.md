# Products Cart

#### Create a shopping cart application that allows the user to add and remove items. When an item is added, display it in the cart with a unique key. If the cart is empty, display a message to the user indicating that there are no items in the cart.

**Note:** Use the following class names
- `container` for products container
- `item` for each item inside container
- `cart` for cart-section
